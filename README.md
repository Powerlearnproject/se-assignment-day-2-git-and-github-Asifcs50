## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?
Version control is a system of tracking changes made to code over time. Github is popular due to it being an online store of repositories. This allows developers to collaborate on projects without having to be in the same place. Version control maintains project integrity by making it possible to check exactly what code was added to the project that caused it to crash and therefore save time when debugging.

## Describe the process of setting up a new repository on GitHub. What are the key steps involved, and what are some of the important decisions you need to make during this process?
Once one has a github account, go to the main dashboard and then navigate to the left side of the screen where all your repositories are listed. Click the 'new' button at the top of the list and you'll be brought to the new repo page. Give your repository a name that complies with the naming rules and an optional description. Then pick whether your repo will be public or private. Finally add a license that complies with the purpose of the repo and click the 'create repository' button at the bottom. Important decisions include the name of the repo, whether the repo will be public or private and the license picked.

## Discuss the importance of the README file in a GitHub repository. What should be included in a well-written README, and how does it contribute to effective collaboration?
A README file is generally used to describe the project and its purpose and set rules for contributions if the project is open source. It should include a short description of the project, its purpose and how to use it, links to the documentation, and any rules for open source contributors. This helps contributors better understand exactly what is required of them and therefore contribute code that is relevant to the project.

## Compare and contrast the differences between a public repository and a private repository on GitHub. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each, particularly in the context of collaborative projects?
A public repo will be available to any github user without requiring any special permissions. It is very advantageous for open source projects as it is accessible to anyone hence having a much larger talent pool to get contributions from and hence problems can be solved relatively quickly. It can be disadvantageous for the same reason as it would be relatively easy for someone to introduce malicious code into the project.

A private repo is available to only the creator and the users they grant permission. It is advantageous for closed source projects as it prevents unknown people from contributing irrelevant or potentially malicious code to the project. It can be disadvantageous as it has a much smaller pool of devs to receive contributions from and hence a problem might go unsolved for a relatively long time if none of them can solve it.

## Detail the steps involved in making your first commit to a GitHub repository. What are commits, and how do they help in tracking changes and managing different versions of your project?
Commits are basically save points for a project. They keep track of the code in the project at the time of the commit. They are essential in version control as different commits will have differences in code hence showing what changed between the various versions and this helps in managing the code versions as code can just be rolled back to a previous commit instead of having to delete and rewrite blocks of code.
To make a commit to a github repo, the local directory must first have git initialised to track it. It should also be connected to a github repo via the add origin command. Next, any required changes can be made to the files and then the files are staged with the git add command. Then the changes can be commited and a message added with the git commit command. Finally, the changes are also made to the github repo with the git push command.

## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.
Branching is important as it allows devs to work on small parts of the project without messing with the rest of the code. It works by creating a copy of the code within the repo thus allowing the dev to change the required stuff and then merge them back into the main code. A branch can be created on github by clicking on the branches button on the menu above the file list. This leads to a page with a list of all the branches of the repo and a button to create a new branch. Clicking on it brings a popup asking for details of the new branch such as the name. After filling them in, click on create and the new branch will be created. The branch can then be used like a regular repository and when changes have been made, a pull request can be submitted to request for a merge.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?
Pull requests are important in collaboration as they provide a way for different devs to have their code reviewed by the repo owner before being merged into the main code in order to avoid merge conflicts, thus not disrupting the work of the other devs. Creating one involves first having a branch or fork of the original code and once the changes have been made, the contribute button can be clicked and then click on open pull request. For the owner, once they have reviewed the code, they can simply merge the relevant pull requests.

## Discuss the concept of "forking" a repository on GitHub. How does forking differ from cloning, and what are some scenarios where forking would be particularly useful?
Forking is the creation of another repo that is a copy of the first one. It differs from cloning in that it creates an entirely new independent repo and any changes to the code there would not affect the code in the original one. Scenarios in which it would be useful include open source projects. As directly changing the code of the original project may cause conflicts if multiple devs change the same thing, forking prevents this by allowing each dev to work on their own copies of the repo and then starting pull requests to have the original owner inspect the code and integrate only the code they require.

## Examine the importance of issues and project boards on GitHub. How can they be used to track bugs, manage tasks, and improve project organization? Provide examples of how these tools can enhance collaborative efforts.

## Reflect on common challenges and best practices associated with using GitHub for version control. What are some common pitfalls new users might encounter, and what strategies can be employed to overcome them and ensure smooth collaboration?
Best practices for using github include: providing clear, concise readmes, forking repos that you need to work on but do not belong to you, understanding the various licenses available.
